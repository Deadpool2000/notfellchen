## Version 0.4.0

Version 0.4.0 has added support for search-as-you-type when searching for animals to adopt. Furthermore, the display of
maps in the search has been majorly improved.

Photon has been added as geocoding source option which allows to use this functionality.

Further improvements include the representation of rescue organizations and tooltips.

One of the biggest features is the addition of search subscriptions. These allow you to not only
search for currently active adoption notices but to subscribe to that search so that you get notified if there are new
rats in your search area in the future.

For developers the new API documentation might come in handy, it can be found at
